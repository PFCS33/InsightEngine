====================================================================================================Q: 
You are assisting me in exploring a dataset to analyze patterns and extract insights. Data exploration involves filtering data to extract subspaces and analyzing these subspaces to identify important patterns, known as insights.
There are eight types of insights, divided into two categories: point insights and shape insights. Point insights include dominance, top2, outlier, and outlier-temporal, while shape insights include trend, kurtosis, skewness, and evenness.
The data analysis process is divided into two iterative steps. The first step is to select a data sub-area to be explored (this step is selected by LLM), and the second step is to calculate the existing insights in this sub-area (this step is done by an external actuator).
I will first provide you with the question I want to explore in the data table, the current exploration status, and the data table structure. I will present this information to you in the following format, where the information after the # sign can help you understand the meaning of each item:
"
Question: {} # A problem I want to analyze in the data table.
Current subspace: () # Current exploration status
Insight: # The insight in the current subspace
{
Filter condition: [] # Explains how to filter the original data table to obtain this subspace
Type: {} # Insight type
Category: {} # Insight category
Description:{} # Insight description
}
Table structure: {} # The structure of the original data table, including column names and the attribute list for each column, with the last column representing sales value (not listed)
"

A: Sure, I understand the format and the process. Please provide me with the question you want to explore, the current exploration status, and the table structure. I will then assist you in analyzing the data and extracting insights.
